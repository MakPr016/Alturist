## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

### Login & Wallet Connection
Contributors log in via GitHub and connect their crypto wallet.

### Task Creation & Reward Locking
Repo owners add repositories, create tasks, and lock token rewards upfront in a Move smart contract.

### Task Completion & PR Submission
Contributors browse tasks, pick one, and submit a pull request (PR).

### Instant Payout via Webhooks
When the PR is merged, GitHub Webhooks trigger the Move smart contract, releasing tokens directly into the contributor's wallet.

This process guarantees instant, trustless payments for accepted contributions.
